Dependencies:
Needs ErrorBarLogPlots.m in the same directory as BatchMultiFit.m

For the export of the pictures the frontend (XML.exe) will be always invoked for rendering -> needs a X server!
https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/136574/exporting-plots-on-a-remote-machine-without-display-in-script-model


On a local machine, with running X server, run script via:
MathKernel -noprompt -run "<<run_BatchMultiFit.m" >> run_BatchMultiFit.log &


In case of a ssh session to a remote headless server you can ssh -Y ... to forward your local X server. However this will work only as long the ssh connection is up.


In case of a ssh session to a remote headless server which you have/wanna disconnect at some point you can use following 3 options:
(1) a VNC-server running on the headless server (works soso)
(2) similarly a NX server on the headless server (works well)
(3) use xvfb on the headless server (recommended)

Further information:

to (1)
start on the server a VNC-server via: 
vncserver :1 [-alwaysshared] [-localhost]
export DISPLAY=<server-IP>:1  [or export DISPLAY=localhost:1]

Note that some VNC-servers (TightVNC) may crash if there are more than 6 parallel jobs.

to (2)
NX (NoMachine) works usually much better regarding stability as VNC, however it is closed source.

to (3):
sudo apt-get install xvfb (for Debain based distros)

in the ssh session to the headless server start script with screen plus xvfb-run:
screen -d -m xvfb-run MathKernel -noprompt -run "<<run_BatchMultiFit.m" >> run_BatchMultiFit.log 

after disconnection, xvfb is still running and allows the rendering from XML.exe

ps -e | grep X
should show sth like
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 640x480x16 -nolisten tcp -auth /tmp/xvfb-run.WHQ2Cz/Xauthority
